            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Web Developer, Mobile Apps Developer, Game Developer</p>
            <p>Currently a student enrolled in university, my interests of programming fall
                into web development, mobile applications, and game development. I specialize very well in 
                front-end-development. Currently this site is a building ground for my portfolio website, planning to move this
                all into React at some point.

            <h3>Project 1 Grade & GPA Calculator App</h3>
            <p>First project I did to get back into web development and to learn React so, I can enhance my
                front-end skills. This web application is as it states, it's a calculator that helps calculates your grades and GPA
                for the courses you are taking. The technologies used were HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React. I also had designed a smooth
                and responsive UI since, developing UI is very important for the user. 
            </p>
            <p>As stated this is a building ground will add more or interesting projects later on in the future
                for the test of my projects please see my Github. <a href="https://github.com/T2703">GitHub Page</a>
